            <h2>A little bit about Me</h2>
            <h3>My achievements within the boundaries of self-improvement as an IT-specialist</h3>
            <p>I don't have any visible big breakthroughs in the IT industry, but there are things that I can be proud of.</p>
            <p>All my life I was a pure humanist, but in a year I was able to prepare for the Unified State Exam in computer science with 75 points, having written the last task with 3 out of 4 points.</p>
            <p>In one semester at the Far Eastern Federal University, I got acquainted with the basics of programming languages ​​such as C++, C, Python, now I am at the stage of studying C#, Java Script, HTML markup language and CSS style language.</p>
            <p>While writing this clumsy site, I realized that website layout is a very interesting activity that I would like to master.</p>

            <h3>Goals and objectives that I strive to master within the IT sphere</h3>
            <p>My goal for the near future is to solve the "Meeting" task in C++ for Pavel Rostislavovich (respectively, to get a credit in the subject of "Algorithms and data structures").</p>
            <p>I intend to master the technologies of web programming, application creation, and neural networks technology at a good level in order to finally "find" myself in the IT industry.</p>
            <p>By the beginning of the 4th semester, she intends to find a job/part-time job in my specialty to hone and improve my skills.</p>
            
            <h3>Looks like I have a brain</h3>
            <p>If you look at the photo above, you can see that I have a brain. True, it is not in my head, but It is!</p>
            <p>P.S. this is a real human brain.</p>
